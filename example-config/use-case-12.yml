# Example 12: Relays DNStap stream to multiple listeners without decoding it.
#
# As prerequisites, we assume you have
# - a DNS server which supports DNSTap (unbound, bind, powerdns, etc) for more informations about dnstap,
#   read the following page: https://dmachard.github.io/posts/0001-dnstap-testing/

# If turned on, debug messages are printed in the standard output
global:
  trace:
    verbose: true

multiplexer:
  # Listen on tcp/6000 for incoming DNSTap protobuf messages from dns servers
  collectors:
    - name: relay-in
      dnstap-relay:
        listen-ip: 0.0.0.0
        listen-port: 6000

  # Redirect DNSTap to two destinations
  loggers:
    - name: relay-out1
      dnstap:
        remote-address: 127.0.0.1
        remote-port: 6001
    - name: relay-out2
      dnstap:
        remote-address: 127.0.0.1
        remote-port: 6002

  routes:
    - from: [ relay-in ]
      to: [ relay-out1, relay-out2 ]
